# 👋 Hi, I'm Walker Rickord

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a PhD student in Harvard-MIT's [Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.mit.edu) program, studying computer science at MIT and clinical medicine at Harvard Medical School. I work under Dr. [Marinka Zitnik](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu). See the lab's work [here](https://github.com/mims-harvard).

Previously, I completed a BS in bioengineering, BS in psychology, and minor in computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Prior to my starting my PhD, I worked on peptide discovery ([Paul Jensen](http://jensenlab.net/people/), University of Michigan), real-time object tracking for microrobotics (Hakan Ceylan, Mayo Clinic), neuromorphic vision sensing (Suma Cardwell, Sandia National Laboratories), and electrolyte monitoring using the ECG ([Nephra](https://nephramed.wordpress.com)).
